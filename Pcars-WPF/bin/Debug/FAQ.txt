CREST - CARS REST API v1.0.2

(C) 2015 Lars Rosenquist

If you are reading this file it means you have successfully downloaded and extracted CREST! To run the application:

1. Double click the CREST executable file, or execute from the command line.
2. Open a browser (preferrably Chrome or Firefox) or your favorite REST or HTTP client and go to http://localhost:8080/crest/v1/api.

This should give a JSON response with a notification that Project CARS is not running or Shared Memory is not enabled. So:

3. Start Project CARS.
4. Go to Options -> Visuals -> Hardware and enable 'Shared Memory'.
5. Repeat step 2.
6. Success!

FAQ

Q: When trying to run CREST, Windows complains about security and it won't start.
A: I didn't sign the binary, so Windows will not allow the binary to start by default. Please allow/unblock it to allow operation. Also, always be sure to download ONLY from http://cars-rest-api.com

Q: When trying to run CREST, Windows complains about missing DDLs (e.g. MSVCR120.DLL or similar)
A: Download and install the Visual C++ runtime from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784 (vcredist_x86.exe) and try again.

Q: When trying to run CREST, Windows Firewall asks for network access.
A: CREST needs to access the local network, or you can't access it. Please allow access.
